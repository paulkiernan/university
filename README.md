# Programming University

List of projects anyone can use to help familiarize themselves with some of the
fundamental concepts of programming. These projects are divided into individual
lessons aimed at guiding a student through elementary concepts first and then
exploring more advanced topics

I wrote these lessons with Python as the subject language in mind but they can
be completed with most other languages as well.

Many of these lessons have been collected from different corners of the
internet. I've included credit to the author(s) in each of the lessons where it
is due. Thanks to all of these people in advance!


## The Lessons:

1. Lesson 1: [Guess the Number](Lesson1/README.md)


## Getting Started:

Simply clone this repo and get to work on the projects in their respective
folders!
